fix groupedMapReduce, it yields an error "could not match stream with object"

insert and co should take arbitrary terms

A successful insert gives an error:
*** Exception: key missing in response

generalise run and queries:
-- list of (Document, FromJSON)
-- batchresults

display backtraces

use attribute lists for let (let' ["a" := b, "c" := 3]

I feel that parts of the code could be simplified a lot
